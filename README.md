A UI exercise for UI applicants at OneMain

A simple form, similar to one you might encounter working for us.

Assume the form submits to a secure backend.
All fields are required, though the form changes depending on if you are planing to use a debit card or bank account.
Account, routing, and credit card numbers, as well as CVV, should be numbers only.
CVV should be exactly 3 numbers.
Routing number should be no more than 9 numbers.
Get as close to the design as you can using whatever libraries/frameworks you’re most comfortable with. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Try not to spend more than 3 hours on this, but feel free space it out over a couple of days. We know a work/life balance is important and exercises like this just add on to that.

We’re just looking for a simple front-end only implementation of this. Assume that the actual form submits to a secure backend. The only validations we’re looking for are the ones spelled out in the description.

Your response should be a folder containing any HTML, CSS, and JS you’ve written. We should be able to just open the index file to view the exercise.

Feel free to return the folder as a zip file or upload it to your GitHub. Either way, please let me know when you’ve completed the exercise so that we can evaluate your work.

If you have any additional questions or need assistance, please reach out as soon as possible.

# Where to find project requirements:

Assume the form submits to a secure backend.
_this form is created in front end format only with HTML, CSS, JS, and bootstrap. Please let me know if you would like me to add Node.js, Rails, or PHP features._

All fields are required, though the form changes depending on if you are planing to use a debit card or bank account.
_All fields are set to required in HTML5 and validate syntax there as well. Feel free to let me know if you would like JS validation written in addition to HTML5_ 

*in order to access credit vs debit features* _credit or debit must be selected from the dropdown menu for the appropriate box to appear_

Account, routing, and credit card numbers, as well as CVV, should be numbers only.
_all features are set to only accept numbers. CVV is set to accept 3 numbers and routing is set to accept 9 numbers. Account numbers are flexible to reflect the flexibility of different bankers._

CVV should be exactly 3 numbers.
_See above_

Routing number should be no more than 9 numbers.
_see above_

Get as close to the design as you can using whatever libraries/frameworks you’re most comfortable with. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
_designed using boostrap and a11y standards as well._
